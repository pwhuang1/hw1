By importing csv so that the program can approach to the csv file and write the data into the new variable "data".

Adding three new variables "target_data", "target_data_removed", "data1".
Adding five more new variables "target_data1", "target_data2", "target_data3", "target_data4", "target_data5". 

"targer_data_removed" is to store the data after removing the original data whose value of the TEMP (temperature) column is '-99.000' or '-999.000'.

"target_data1", "target_data2", "target_data3", "target_data4", "target_data5" are the variables to store the data filtered by each 'station_id' from "targer_data_removed". 

"data1" is the place that stores the data which only included the temperature value of each specific station_id. 

"target_data" is for the storage of the output data that we would like to display at the end which contains the station_id and the maximum temperature of each specific station_id.
